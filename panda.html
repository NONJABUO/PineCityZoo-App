          <h3>PANDA</h3>
         <p>The giant panda has a body shape typical of bears. It has black fur on its ears, limbs, shoulders and around the eyes. The rest of the animal's coat is white.[33] The bear's distinctive coloration appears to serve as camouflage in both winter and summer environments as they do not hibernate. The white areas serve as camouflage in snow, while the black shoulders and legs conceal them in shade.</p>
        <p>The black ears may be used to display aggression,[34] while the eye patches might facilitate them identifying one another.[34][36] The giant panda's thick, woolly coat keeps it warm in the cool forests of its habitat.</p>

         <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
         <P>Giant pandas once roamed across Southeast Asia from Myanmar to northern Vietnam. Their range in China spanned much of the southeast region.</P>
