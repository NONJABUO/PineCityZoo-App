          <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
         <P>Phacochoerus is a genus in the family Suidae, commonly known as warthogs (pronounced wart-hog).</P>
         <p>Although covered in bristly hairs, a warthog's body and head appear largely bare, from a distance, with only a crest of hair along the back and the tufts on the face and tail being obvious.</p>

         <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
         <P>They are pigs who live in open and semi-open habitats, even in quite arid regions, in sub-Saharan Africa. </P>
