          <h3>TIGER</h3>
         <P>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is a large cat and a member of the genus Panthera native to Asia. It has a powerful, muscular body with a large head and paws, a long tail and orange fur with black, mostly vertical stripes. It is traditionally classified into nine recent subspecies, though some recognise only two subspecies, mainland Asian tigers and the island tigers of the Sunda Islands.</P>
         <P>The tiger is an apex predator and preys mainly on ungulates, which it takes by ambush.</P>
         
         <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
         <P>Throughout the tiger's range, it inhabits mainly forests, from coniferous and temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the Russian Far East and Northeast China to tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests on the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia</P>
